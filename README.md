# Collaborative Coding HW

Today we gave pair programming a try. For many of us this was our first time having to really express coding concepts in words.

Tonight's homework is two parts:

1. Reflect on today's pair programming and write out your thoughts.
  - What went well? What went poorly?
  - Which code concepts did you have the hardest time talking about? Why?
  - Any other thoughts about the experience
2. Read up on a topic related to communication on a development team (e.g. pair programming, code reviews, Postmortems, etc) and write some thoughts about them
  - Which articles / blog posts did you read?
  - Did you learn any new terms related to team communication?
  - What tips/tricks did you learn that you can work on immediately?
  - What tips/tricks did you learn that you can look for opportunities to apply later in your career?

## Using GFM

Type your reflections on the topics specified above using [GFM (Github Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/). GFM is a common format used for things like README files (this file is formatted in GFM).

Here are how you write some common elements in GFM:

- **paragraphs** – Paragraphs are simply typed out with an empty line between them. No special formatting needed:
  ```
  Hi, I'm a paragraph.
  
  Me too. I'm another paragraph.
  ```
- **headings** – Headings are on their own line preceded by a 'hash' symbol and a space.
  ```
  # I am a top-level heading (H1)
  ## I am another heading (H2)
  ### More heading (H3)
  #### I am another heading (H4)
  ```
- **lists** – Lists are on their own line, preceded by `- ` for unordered (bullet) lists and `1. ` etc for numbered lists.
  ```
  - I am a bullet point
  - Another bullet

  1. Let's count
  2. Count some more
  3. Three! Three list items! A-ha-haaa~~
  ```
- **code** – Inline code is surrounded by backticks (\`). Multi-line code blocks are surrounded by three backticks:
  ````
  ```
  // this is a block of code
  // it will get highlighted accordingly
  var a = 5;
  var b = 3;
  var c = a + b;
  ```
  ````
